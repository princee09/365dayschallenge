46. Permutations




Imagine you have a set of distinct items, like different colored balls red, blue, and green. 
You want to find every possible way you can arrange these balls in a line.

For example, one way is red-blue-green, another is red-green-blue, and so on. 
Our goal is to list all such possible arrangements.

To do this, we use a method where we fix one ball at the front and then arrange the remaining 
ones in all possible ways. After finishing one arrangement, we go back (undo our last step) and 
try another ball in the front. This going forward and coming back is called backtracking.

We keep repeating this until all positions are filled in every way possible. Since the input 
has no duplicates, we don’t worry about repeated arrangements.

This method is efficient because instead of copying the whole list again and again, 
we just swap the elements and work with the same list, saving space and time.













47. Permutations II






Now imagine the same situation, but this time the balls are not all unique maybe you have two red balls and one green.

If you use the method from the previous question directly, you will end up getting duplicate arrangements, 
like red-red-green appearing more than once. But we want only unique arrangements.

So, we first sort the balls, which puts all the same colors together. Then, while arranging them, 
we keep track of which ball we’ve already used in a particular spot. And very importantly, 
when we see a repeated ball (like two reds), we only use the first one if the previous one has already been used in that round.

This trick ensures that we skip duplicate combinations and get only the distinct ways to arrange the balls.

We still use backtracking fixing one ball at a time and going deeper, then stepping back
but now with extra care to not repeat anything that looks the same.
