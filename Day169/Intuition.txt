3330. Find the Original Typed String I



Imagine Alice is typing something on a computer. She’s a bit clumsy and 
may accidentally hold a key for too long. That means if she wanted to type 
the letter "c" just once, it might show up as "ccccc" on the screen. But this 
mistake only happens once while typing the whole word.

So, if we see a word like "abbcccc", we know maybe one group of repeated 
letters (like "cccc") was typed too many times. We need to find out how 
many original words Alice could have actually intended, by possibly shrinking 
just one group of repeating letters. We go through the word, look at groups 
where the same letter appears more than once in a row, and count how many 
different ways we could reduce just one of those. Then we also count the original 
word as a valid possibility. The total count gives us how many possible original words 
she might have intended.










997. Find the Town Judge







Imagine a town where people can either trust each other or not. 
There’s a rumor that someone in town is the judge. This judge is 
different because they trust nobody, but everyone else in the town trusts them.



So, if we want to figure out who the judge is, we look at each person and 
keep track of two things — how many people they trust, and how many people 
trust them. If someone trusts others, we subtract points from them. If someone 
is trusted by others, we add points to them. At the end, the person who didn’t trust 
anyone but was trusted by everyone else will have the highest score — exactly equal 
to the number of people in town minus one. That’s our judge. If no one fits that description, then there’s no judge in the town.
