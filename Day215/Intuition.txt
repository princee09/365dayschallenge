Question 114: Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List





Think of a family tree where each person may have children on the left side and right side. 
The task is to turn this tree into a straight chain, like a necklace, so that each person is linked only to the 
next one on the right side. The order of people in this chain should follow the same order you would visit them 
if you walked the tree from top to bottom, always going left before right. To do this, we look at 
each person: if they have a left child, we connect the rightmost person from that left side to 
the original right side, then move the left side into the right, and erase the left link. 
By repeating this, the tree naturally stretches into a single straight line without using extra memory.









Question 946: Validate Stack Sequences









Imagine you are stacking plates on a table, one by one, in the order given by the first list. 
At any moment, you are allowed to remove the plate from the top of the stack. The second list tells you 
in which order the plates should be removed. The question asks if it is possible to remove the plates in 
exactly that order while following the rule that you can only take from the top of the stack. To check this, 
we place each plate from the first list onto the stack. After placing a plate, if the top plate matches the 
next one we are supposed to remove, we take it off. We keep doing this until all plates are either matched and 
removed or we get stuck. If we successfully remove all plates in the right order, then the answer is yes, otherwise it is no.
