Question 257. Binary Tree Paths



Think of the tree as a family tree where each person can have two children, one on the left and 
one on the right. What the problem asks is to write down all possible paths starting from the top ancestor 
(the root) and going down to the last descendant who has no children (a leaf). The way we solve this is by 
walking down the tree step by step, remembering the path we took so far. Whenever we reach someone who has no children, 
that means the path is complete, so we write it down. Then we go back and try the other possible paths. 
By doing this carefully, we can collect all the paths from the top to every leaf.






Question 299. Bulls and Cows



This game is about comparing two strings of numbers. Imagine you have a secret code and your friend is guessing it. 
If your friend gets the right digit in the exact right place, that is a bull. If the digit exists in your secret code 
but is in the wrong place, that is a cow. To find bulls, we just compare both numbers position by position and count 
how many match perfectly. For the cows, we only look at the digits that did not match and see how many of those 
are present in both numbers. But since one digit can only be used once, we only count the minimum times that 
digit appeared in both. In the end, we give the answer in the format showing the number of bulls and cows.
