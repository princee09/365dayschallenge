680. Valid Palindrome II






We start by looking from both ends of the word at the same time, moving inwards, 
checking if the letters match. If they always match, it is already a palindrome. 
If we ever find two letters that do not match, we are allowed to remove only one letter. 
So we try two possibilities remove the letter from the left side or remove the letter from 
the right side and then check if what remains is a palindrome. If either choice works, 
the answer is true. This works fast because we only scan the string at most twice.







738. Monotone Increasing Digits





We write the number as separate digits and look from left to right until we see the first 
place where the order of digits is broken (a digit is smaller than the one before it). 
When this happens, we move leftwards, reducing the digit before the break by one, 
and if that causes more problems to the left, we keep going until the order is fixed. 
Then, to make the number as large as possible while keeping the order, 
we change all digits to the right into 9. This way we get the biggest number possible that still has digits in non-decreasing order.
