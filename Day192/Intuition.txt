415. Add Strings




Imagine you are adding two numbers by hand, like in a notebook, column by column from the 
right side (units place) to the left side (tens, hundreds, etc). Since the numbers are 
given as strings, you can't just directly add them like integers. So what we do is, 
we start from the last character of each string (which represents the smallest digit). 
We take one digit from each number, convert them to integers by subtracting the ASCII value of '0', add 
them along with any carry from the previous step. If the sum of the digits is more than 9, 
we keep the last digit in the result and carry over the tens to the next addition. 
We repeat this until we've gone through both numbers completely and finally add any 
remaining carry. Since we built the answer from the back to the front, we reverse
the result before returning it. This way, we mimic how a human would do manual addition of large numbers on paper.










541. Reverse String II




Imagine you are given a long rope made of letters. You are asked to go through the rope in chunks of size 2k. 
For each such chunk, your task is to flip the first k letters but leave the next k letters as they are. 
If you reach near the end of the rope and there are fewer than k letters left, just flip all of them. 
If you have at least k but not full 2k letters left, flip the first k and leave the rest. 
You keep moving like this chunk by chunk till the whole rope is processed. 
Flipping here means reversing the order of the characters â€” like turning "abc" into "cba". 
We do this flipping by swapping the first and last letters of that part and then move inward until we reach the center.
