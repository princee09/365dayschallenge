848. Shifting Letters



Imagine you have a word, and for each letter you have a number telling you how many times to push it forward in the alphabet. 
But each number means you push not just that letter, but all letters before it too. Instead of moving letters again and again 
from the start each time, you start from the end and keep track of the total pushes needed so far. You add the current letter’s pushes 
to your running total, wrap it around the alphabet so it never goes beyond ‘z’, and change the letter right there. This way you 
avoid repeating work and finish much faster.

1140. Stone Game II



Think of a row of stone piles and two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns. On each turn, the player can take a 
few piles from the start, but the allowed number grows based on the last move. Both want the most stones possible. 
The trick is to figure out the best move now by looking at what would happen later if the opponent also plays perfectly. 
We work backward, imagining all possible moves and recording the best result for each situation 
so we do not have to think about it again. This way, we make sure Alice always gets the 
maximum possible stones she can, no matter how Bob plays.
