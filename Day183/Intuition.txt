3136. Valid Word



To check if a word is valid, we look at a few simple rules. First, the word must 
have at least 3 characters. Second, it should only contain English letters 
(like A to Z or a to z) and numbers. If there are any special characters like $, #, or @, it is immediately invalid. Third, 
it must have at least one vowel. Vowels are letters like a, e, i, o, and u. Lastly, 
it must also have at least one consonant, which is just a non-vowel letter like b, c, d, etc. 
So, we go through each character in the word. If we see any bad character, we return false right away. 
While checking, if we find at least one vowel and one consonant, then we know it's valid and return true. If not, it’s not valid.











1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element






Here, we want to find out how many times we can make one number appear in the array after 
we are allowed to increase some numbers up to a total of k times. Think of it like this: we can increase 
numbers to make them equal to the biggest one in a group. But we can only use k total steps. 
So we sort the array so that we can think about making all smaller numbers into the larger one, 
from left to right. We slide a window over the array and keep checking how many 
changes we’d need to make all numbers inside that window equal to the biggest one in that window. 
If it takes more than k operations, we shift the window forward. We keep track of the biggest 
window we find that works within k operations. The size of that window is the answer.
