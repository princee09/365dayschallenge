501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree


Imagine you are walking through a garden where flowers are arranged in increasing order of height. 
Some flowers have the same height. You want to find out which height occurs the most — that is, 
which flower height is most repeated.

Since the garden is arranged in order, as you walk, you can easily count how many times each height appears. 
Whenever you see a new height, you check if the number of times the previous one appeared is more than your current maximum. 
If yes, you update your record. If it’s equal, you just note it down as another frequently appearing height.

In the same way, we walk through the binary search tree in order and count how many times each number shows up, 
and we keep track of the number that appears the most. We do this smartly, without using extra space, 
by just remembering the last number we saw and how many times we saw it.












515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row





Think of a big tree where each branch level is like a floor in a building. Now, you stand on each floor and 
look around to find the tallest person standing on that floor. You repeat this for every floor from 
top to bottom and write down the height of the tallest person you saw on each floor.

In the same way, we look at the tree level by level — starting from the top level (root), and for each level, 
we find the largest number among all the nodes present. We use a queue (like a line of people) to 
help us go through one floor at a time. After visiting all levels, we end up with a list of the biggest values from each level of the tree.
