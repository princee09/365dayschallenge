Question 49: Group Anagrams




The problem is about putting words that are made of the same letters into the same group. 
For example, "eat" and "tea" both use the letters e, a, and t, so they should be grouped together. 
The trick is to find a way to recognize when two words are built from the same set of letters, no matter the order. 
The solution does this by counting how many times each letter appears in the word. 
This count becomes like a fingerprint for the word. Words that have the same fingerprint are anagrams and are placed together in the same group.











Question 32: Longest Valid Parentheses





This problem is about finding the longest stretch of brackets that are correctly matched. 
A correct pair is one opening bracket "(" and one closing bracket ")" that fit together. 
If we take the string of brackets, sometimes they do not all match. The challenge is to find the longest part of 
the string where the brackets are balanced and valid. The solution uses a stack, which is like a 
pile where we keep track of unmatched opening brackets. When we see a closing bracket, we try to 
match it with the last opening bracket from the pile. If it matches, we know we have a valid piece. 
By checking how long that piece is, we keep track of the maximum length. In the end, the biggest balanced portion gives the answer.
