1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer


Imagine you are given a number, and you are allowed to change all appearances of one digit to any other digit.
 You can do this twice, separately. Your goal is to make the biggest number possible once and the smallest number 
possible the second time, and then find the difference between the two.

To make the largest number, you try to replace some digit in the number with 9, because 9 is the biggest possible
 digit and will help increase the value the most.

To make the smallest number, you replace some digit with either 1 or 0, depending on whether it’s the first digit 
or not. But you must make sure the number doesn’t start with 0, because that would be invalid.

Once you get your biggest and smallest numbers, just subtract the smaller one from the bigger one to get the answer.




108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree



You are given a list of numbers that are already sorted in increasing order. You need to turn this list into
 a binary tree in a way that the tree is balanced, which means it doesn’t lean too much to the left or right.

To do that, you pick the middle number of the list and make it the root of the tree. Then you repeat the same
 process for the left half of the list to build the left part of the tree, and the right half of the list to build the right part.

This way, every time you split the list and choose the middle, you are making sure the tree stays even on both 
sides, resulting in a height-balanced binary search tree.
