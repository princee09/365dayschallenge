1332: Remove Palindromic Subsequences

The intuition for this problem is built on a very important observation about the composition of the string. Since the string contains only 
two letters 'a' and 'b', we can think about this problem in a simplified way.

A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards. The key insight here is that any sequence containing only one type 
of character is automatically a palindrome. For example, "aaa" is a palindrome and "bbb" is also a palindrome.

Now, if the entire string is already a palindrome, we can remove it completely in just one single operation. We simply identify that the 
whole string reads the same forwards and backwards, so we can remove it all at once.

However, if the string is not a palindrome, we can still solve this efficiently. We can remove all the 'a' characters in one operation 
because they form a palindromic subsequence. Then in a second operation, we remove all the 'b' characters because they also form a 
palindromic subsequence. This means the maximum number of operations needed is always two.

The code implements this logic by first checking if the string is empty, in which case zero steps are needed. Then it uses two pointers, 
one starting from the left end and one from the right end, moving towards the center while comparing characters. If at any point the 
characters don't match, we know it's not a palindrome and return two. If all characters match throughout the entire check, we return one.







2824: Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

The intuition for this problem involves systematically checking all possible pairs of numbers in the list to see if their sum is less than 
the given target value. Since we're looking for pairs where the first index is less than the second index, we need to consider every 
combination of two different positions in the array.

The straightforward approach is to use two loops. The outer loop goes through each element in the array, and for each element, the inner 
loop goes through all the elements that come after it in the array. This ensures that we only consider pairs where the first index is less 
than the second index, which matches our requirement.

For each pair of numbers we check, we simply add their values together and compare this sum with the target. If the sum is strictly less 
than the target, we count this pair as valid. We maintain a counter that increments every time we find such a valid pair.

The code implements this by initializing a count variable to zero. Then it uses nested loops where the outer loop variable i goes from the 
first element to the second last element, and the inner loop variable j goes from i+1 to the last element. This pairing ensures i is always 
less than j. For each pair nums[i] and nums[j], if their sum is less than target, we increase our count. Finally, we return the total count 
of valid pairs.
