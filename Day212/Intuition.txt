326. Power of Three





Imagine you have a magical number that is made by multiplying 3 with itself again and again. 
So, 3, then 9, then 27, then 81, and so on. If I give you a number and ask if it is one of these magical numbers, 
the normal way is to keep dividing it by 3 to check. But we can be smarter. Since there is a biggest magical 
number that fits in our computerâ€™s number limit, we can store that biggest one, and simply check if 
your number divides it perfectly with no remainder. If it divides perfectly, it means your number 
is also a magical number made from 3s. This way, we do not need to do any loops or repeated checking.








617. Merge Two Binary Trees






Think of two family trees drawn side by side. Some people in both trees have the same position, 
while some spots are empty in one tree and filled in the other. Now, if we overlap these trees, 
wherever two people match up in the same position, we add their ages together and that becomes the new age for that spot. 
If one spot is empty in one tree but filled in the other, we just take the filled one as it is. 
We do this for every spot starting from the top (the roots) and keep going down to all branches 
until we finish merging everything. In the end, we get a single tree that is the combination of both.
