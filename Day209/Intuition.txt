611. Valid Triangle Number



Think of having a bunch of sticks of different lengths, and you want to see in how many ways you 
can pick three sticks to form a triangle. The rule for making a triangle is that the sum of the 
lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick. To make this process 
faster, we first arrange the sticks in order from smallest to largest. Then we choose the biggest 
stick and check how many pairs of smaller sticks can be combined with it to make a triangle. 
If two sticks together are long enough, then every stick in between will also work, so 
we can count them all at once instead of checking each separately. This reduces the time spent 
from checking every single combination to a much quicker method.







481. Magical String




Imagine a magical sequence made of only 1s and 2s that has a strange property — if you read the sequence 
in terms of how many times each number appears in a row, you get the sequence itself again. It starts as 1, 2, 2, and 
keeps growing following this rule. To know how many 1s appear in the first ‘n’ numbers of this sequence, we do 
not generate the whole thing blindly. Instead, we keep track of a position that tells us how many times to add 
the next number, and we alternate between adding 1s and 2s. Each time we add a 1, we count it. We stop when we 
reach the first ‘n’ numbers. This way, we build only as much as needed and count the 1s while building it.
