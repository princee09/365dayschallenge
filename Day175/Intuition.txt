1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

Imagine you are a person who loves going to events, but you can only attend one event per day. 
Each event has a start day and an end day, which means you are allowed to attend it on any day in that range.

Now, you want to attend as many events as possible. To do this smartly, first you sort the events by 
their start day so you can go through them in order. Then, for each day, you look at all the events that 
are available to attend starting that day or earlier, and put them into a list.

From this list, you choose the event that ends the earliest, so that you don't block the future days for 
longer events and can attend more overall. You then remove any events from the list that have already expired.

You keep doing this for each day until all events are either attended or expired. By following this 
smart scheduling, you end up attending the maximum number of events possible.








134. Gas Station




Imagine you're on a circular road trip with several gas stations. Each station gives you a 
certain amount of gas, and it costs a certain amount of gas to go from that station to the next one.

You want to find out from which station you can start so that you can make the full circle without running out of fuel.

Here's how you think about it: First, you check if the total gas from all stations is more than or 
equal to the total cost. If it’s not, you know for sure the trip is impossible.

If the total gas is enough, you try to simulate the journey. You start from station 0 and keep track 
of how much gas you have in the tank. Every time you stop at a station, you add the gas it gives and subtract the cost to reach the next one.

If at any point your gas tank becomes negative, it means you can’t start from that station or any 
station before it. So, you restart your trial from the next station and continue the simulation.

Eventually, the first station where you can complete the full circle from becomes your answer.
