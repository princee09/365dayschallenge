Imagine you have two trees, and you want to check if they look exactly the same.

To do that, you start at the root of both trees and compare their values.

If the values are different, then the trees are clearly not the same.

If the values are the same, you go one step further — you check if their left children are the same and then if their right children are the same.

You keep doing this again and again for every corresponding node in both trees.

If at any point, one tree has a node where the other tree has nothing, or the values are different — you stop and say, “Nope, not the same.”

But if you make it through the entire tree without finding any mismatches, then the trees are exactly the same in shape and in values.

It's just like walking through both trees side-by-side and making sure they match at every single step.
