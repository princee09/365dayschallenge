Imagine you are walking through a garden where each plant is connected to two other plants — one on the left and one on the right. Your job is to write down the name (or number) of each plant in a special order:
first visit all the plants on the left, then write down the current plant, and then visit the plants on the right.
This is called inorder traversal.

Now, how do you do this if you don’t want to go in circles or forget where you came from?

We use a basket (a stack) to keep track of the plants (nodes) we've seen but haven't written down yet.
You keep walking left and putting each plant in the basket until you can't go left anymore.
Once you hit the end, you pick the last plant from the basket, write it down, and now go right.
Repeat this process until you've visited all the plants.

This way, we’re making sure to visit everything in the left → center → right order, without getting lost!
