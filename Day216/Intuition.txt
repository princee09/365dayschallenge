Question 1046: Last Stone Weight






Think of it like you have a bunch of heavy stones and you are playing a game. Each time, 
you pick the two heaviest stones and smash them against each other. If they are of the same weight, 
both are destroyed completely. If one is heavier, then only the lighter one breaks and the heavier one 
becomes smaller by the lighter stoneâ€™s weight. You keep doing this until there is at most one stone left. 
The answer is simply the weight of that last stone.











Question 1464: Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array






Here you are given numbers, and you need to pick two of them in such a way that after subtracting 1 from each, 
their multiplication is the largest possible. In simpler terms, to make a product as big as possible, 
you should pick the two largest numbers in the list. For example, if you had numbers 5 and 4, 
then after subtracting 1 from each, you multiply 4 times 3 which is 12.
