1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix
Imagine you are looking at an army training ground where soldiers (represented by 1s) 
are standing in rows, and civilians (represented by 0s) are standing behind them in the 
same row. Each row starts with soldiers, followed by civilians. Your task is to find the 
rows with the weakest strength. A row is weaker if it has fewer soldiers. If two rows have 
the same number of soldiers, the row that appears first is considered weaker. To solve this, 
we simply count the number of soldiers in each row, then sort all the rows from weakest to 
strongest based on the soldier count. Finally, we return the first k weakest rows.







264. Ugly Number II
Ugly numbers are special numbers that can only be made by multiplying 2, 3, or 5 again 
and again. Think of it like this — you are building a list of numbers starting from 1, 
and you are only allowed to use 2, 3, or 5 to make new numbers from the ones already in the list. 
Every time, you look at what would happen if you multiply your current list by 2, by 3, and by 5. 
You then choose the smallest result and add it to the list, making sure you don’t add the same number twice. 
You keep repeating this until you reach the nth number in this list. That nth number is your answer.
