496. Next Greater Element I – :


Imagine you have two lists of numbers. The first list is a smaller one (called nums1), 
and the second one (called nums2) is the complete list that includes all numbers from the first list.
Now, for each number in the first list, your job is to look it up in the second list and find the
first number that is bigger and comes after it. If there's no bigger number after it, just say -1.

To make this fast, we scan the second list from left to right while keeping a pile (called a stack) of 
numbers we’re still waiting to find bigger ones for.
When we find a number that is bigger than what’s on top of our pile, we say “aha, here’s your next greater 
number!” and remember it in a dictionary.
Later, for each number in the first list, we simply look up what we remembered for it.





503. Next Greater Element II :



Now imagine the numbers are in a circle, like a clock, where after the last number, you loop back to the first.
Just like before, we want to find the next number that is bigger than the current one, but this time we can 
also look ahead in a circular way.

We pretend to go through the list twice (as if we looped around once), so we don’t miss any number that could be 
bigger and come after wrapping around.
We use a stack again to keep track of the numbers we’re still trying to find the next greater for.
As we go through the list, if we find a number that's bigger than the one on top of our stack, we record it as 
the answer for that number.
