Imagine you have a list of numbers. Your task is to count how many of these numbers have an even number of digits. Let’s break this down step by step, even if you’re not a techie!

What’s a "digit"?
A digit is a single number (0-9). For example:

12 has 2 digits (1 and 2).

7896 has 4 digits (7, 8, 9, 6).

7 has 1 digit.

An even number of digits means the total digits are 2, 4, 6, etc.

How to Check Even Digits?
Here’s the trick:

Turn the number into a string (like writing it down).

Example: 12 becomes "12", 7896 becomes "7896".

Count the characters in the string.

The length of the string tells you how many digits the number has.

Check if that length is even.

Example Walkthrough
Let’s say the list is [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]:

12 → "12" → Length = 2 → Even ✅

345 → "345" → Length = 3 → Odd ❌

2 → "2" → Length = 1 → Odd ❌

6 → "6" → Length = 1 → Odd ❌

7896 → "7896" → Length = 4 → Even ✅

Total even-digit numbers: 2 (12 and 7896).

Why Does This Work?
When you write a number as a string, every digit becomes a character.

Counting characters is like counting digits by hand, but faster!

If the count is even, the number qualifies.

Alternative (Without Strings)
If you prefer math:

Divide the number by 10 repeatedly until it’s less than 1.

Count how many times you divided.

If the count is even, the number qualifies.

But the string method is simpler to understand and code!

Key Idea
Convert numbers to strings → Check string length → Count even lengths.

Adding two binary strings is like adding two numbers by hand, but simpler because you only deal with 0s and 1s. Here’s how it works:

Binary Addition Basics
In binary:

0 + 0 = 0

0 + 1 = 1

1 + 1 = 10 (this is 2 in decimal, so you write 0 and carry 1).

1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (3 in decimal: write 1 and carry 1).

The key is to handle the carry when the sum of bits exceeds 1.

Step-by-Step Process
Start from the rightmost bit (like how you add numbers from the right).

Add the two bits and any carry from the previous step.

Example: If adding 1 + 1, the sum is 2. You write 0 and carry 1.

Repeat for all bits until both strings are processed.

If there’s a carry left, add it to the result.

Example Walkthrough
Let’s add a = "11" (3 in decimal) and b = "1" (1 in decimal):

Rightmost bits: 1 + 1 = 2 → Write 0, carry 1.

Next bits: 1 + 0 + carry (1) = 2 → Write 0, carry 1.

No bits left, but carry 1 → Write 1.

Combine all bits: 100 (4 in decimal).

Handling Different-Length Strings
If one string is longer (e.g., a = "1010", b = "1011"):

Pad the shorter string with "invisible" leading zeros.

Add bits as usual, treating missing bits as 0.

Why Reverse the Result?
When you add bits from right to left, the result is built in reverse order.

For example, adding "11" and "1" gives 001 during the process, which is reversed to 100 for the final answer.

Key Idea
Add bits one by one, track the carry, and reverse the result at the end.
This mimics manual binary addition and ensures correctness for any input lengths.

Why This Works
Simplicity: Directly mirrors how humans add numbers.

Efficiency: Processes each bit exactly once, making it fast even for large inputs.

Handles Edge Cases: Automatically deals with carries, different string lengths, and leading zeros.
