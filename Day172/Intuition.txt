1652. Defuse the Bomb

Imagine you have a circle of numbers written around a bomb.

Your job is to change each number based on a secret key k.

If k is positive, it means for each number, you must look ahead at the next k numbers 
(going in a circle), add them up, and replace the current number with that sum.

If k is negative, you must look backwards at the previous k numbers (again, looping around 
the circle if needed), and do the same—add them and replace the current number.

If k is zero, you just replace every number with 0.

So, you go around the circle once, look at the neighbors (next or previous based on k), calculate 
their total, and use that to rewrite each number.

To do this fast, instead of calculating the sum again and again from scratch for every number, 
we slide a "window" over the numbers. We add the new number that enters the window and remove the old one that leaves it, so we reuse the calculation smartly.

This way, even with hundreds of numbers, the work stays quick.






1695. Maximum Erasure Value





Think of this like walking through a path filled with numbers.

You can pick a continuous sequence of numbers and remove them, but with one rule—all numbers in the chosen group must be different.

The score you get is the total of all the numbers you remove.

So your goal is to find the longest possible stretch of numbers where no number repeats, and the sum is the highest.

To do this, we use a "sliding window" approach. We start from the beginning and keep adding numbers until we see a repeat.

When we do see a repeat, we slide the starting point forward, removing numbers from our total, until the repeat is gone.

As we go, we always keep track of the highest total we found with all unique numbers.

This way, we cover the entire list only once, and never waste time recalculating everything.

It's like walking on a rope and picking coins, but dropping some when the same one shows up twice, and trying to grab the biggest possible haul without breaking the rules.
