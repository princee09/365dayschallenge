1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String




Imagine you are typing a message and you don’t want to press the same key more than twice in a row. 
If you type three or more same letters back-to-back, you decide to delete the extras.

So you go through the message from left to right.
Each time you see a letter, you check how many times it has appeared right before.
If it appeared less than two times, you keep it.
If it appeared two times already, you skip adding it because three in a row is not allowed.

This way, you build a clean message where no letter appears more than twice in a row.

You only read the message once from left to right, so it is fast and efficient.











139. Word Break




Imagine you are given a long word like a puzzle, and a list of smaller words that you are allowed to use to solve it.

You want to check if you can break the long word into pieces, where each piece is a valid word from the list.

You start from the beginning of the long word and try cutting it at every point.
At each cut, you check:

Is the part before this cut made up of valid words?

And is the part after the cut a valid word?

If both are true, you mark this point as a place where cutting is allowed.

You keep repeating this process until you reach the end of the word.

If at the end you were able to cut the full word into valid dictionary pieces, then the answer is true.

You remember which parts were valid as you go, so you don’t repeat work. This makes it efficient even for long words.
