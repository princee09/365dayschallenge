557. Reverse Words in a String III
We are given a sentence where we have to reverse each word individually, but we must 
not change the order of the words. Think of each word as a small puzzle, and our job is 
to flip the letters of each word, while keeping the words in their original spots. For example, 
if someone says “Let's take LeetCode contest,” we flip the letters of each word like 
turning "Let's" into "s'teL", and "take" into "ekat", and so on. The overall order of the 
words stays the same, we only reverse the letters inside each word.











2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers
Imagine we have a group of players and a group of trainers. Each player needs a certain level 
of support, and each trainer can only handle up to a certain level. We want to match as many 
players to trainers as possible, but only if the trainer can handle the player's needs. 
To do this, we sort both groups from lowest to highest ability or capacity. Then we try to 
match the weakest player to the weakest trainer who can handle them. If a trainer is too weak, 
we skip them and move on to the next. We keep doing this until we’ve gone through both groups, and we count how many pairs we could successfully make.
