2016. Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements



Imagine you are walking through a line of numbers from left to right.

You want to find two numbers where the first comes before the second, and the first number is smaller than the second.

The goal is to find the biggest increase between such a pair.

So as you go through the list, keep track of the smallest number you've seen so far.

At each step, check if the current number is bigger than that smallest one.

If it is, calculate the difference and remember the largest difference you ever find.

If the current number is smaller or equal, update your smallest number so far.

At the end, you’ll have the biggest valid increase from an earlier small number to a later big number.

If no such increase exists, return -1.




2574. Left and Right Sum Differences 




Think of a number line with multiple positions.

For every position in the list, you want to know:

What is the total of all numbers to its left?

What is the total of all numbers to its right?

Then, you just subtract the left total from the right total, and take the positive difference.

To do this efficiently, go through the list once from left to right, and at each step keep adding up numbers to form the leftSum array.

Then go from right to left, doing the same to form the rightSum array.

Once you have both arrays, go through them and at each position, take the absolute difference of left and right sums.

That gives you your final answer for each position.

It’s like checking how unbalanced each point is between its left and right side.
