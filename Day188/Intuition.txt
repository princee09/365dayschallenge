2760. Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold



We are given a list of numbers and a limit value. We need to find the longest stretch of 
numbers (in a row) that starts with an even number, all numbers are smaller than or equal to the limit, 
and the even and odd numbers strictly take turns (like even, odd, even, odd or odd, even, odd, even 
but in our case it must always start with even).

So we check every possible starting point in the list. If a number is even and within the limit, 
we begin checking forward. We continue adding numbers as long as they are within the limit and 
alternate between even and odd. If anything breaks this rule, we stop. We keep track of the longest 
such stretch found. At the end, we return the length of the longest valid sequence.










2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray




We are given a list of numbers and two values: k (how long the subarray must be) and 
m (minimum number of different values needed). A subarray means a continuous piece of the list. 
We want to find the highest possible total (sum) among all subarrays of length k, but only if the subarray contains at least m different numbers.

So we use a sliding window of size k â€” which means we look at a stretch of k numbers 
and slide that window one step at a time. While sliding, we keep track of how many 
different numbers are in the current window and what the total sum is. If the window has at 
least m different numbers, we consider its sum. Among all valid windows, we return the biggest sum found.











2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency




We are given a list of numbers and a value k. We are asked to find the longest stretch of numbers
in a row (a subarray) where no number appears more than k times.

We solve this using a window that grows from left to right. Every time we add a number to the window, 
we increase its count. If any number appears more than k times, that breaks the rule. So we start 
shrinking the window from the left side until all numbers follow the rule again. During this whole process, 
we keep checking and saving the size of the longest valid stretch we found. In the end, we return the size of that longest subarray.
