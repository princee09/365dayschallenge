You are given two numbers n and m.

From 1 to n, you need to split the numbers into two groups:

Group 1: Numbers not divisible by m → Add them all → call this num1

Group 2: Numbers divisible by m → Add them all → call this num2

Now the question is: What is the difference between these two sums?
So, the final answer is: num1 - num2

Instead of looping through all numbers, we can use math formulas:

Total sum from 1 to n = n * (n + 1) / 2

Sum of numbers divisible by m = m * (k * (k + 1) / 2) where k = n / m

Then subtract to find the answer
