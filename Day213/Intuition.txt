2264. Largest 3-Same-Digit Number in String



We are given a long number written as a string, and we need to find the largest group of three same digits 
sitting next to each other. For example, if we have "6777133339", the groups of three same digits are "777" 
and "333". Out of these, "777" is bigger, so we return that. The code simply moves through the number, 
checking every position to see if the next two characters are the same as the current one. If they are, 
we remember the largest digit we have seen so far. In the end, we return that digit three times as our answer, 
or nothing if no such group exists.









324. Wiggle Sort II




We are given a bunch of numbers, and we want to rearrange them so that they go up, down, up, down,
and so on. That means the first number should be smaller than the second, the second bigger than the third, 
the third smaller than the fourth, and so on. To do this efficiently, the code first finds the middle value of 
all the numbers (the median). Then it rearranges the numbers in such a way that bigger numbers are placed in the 
high spots (like peaks) and smaller numbers in the low spots (like valleys). It uses a clever trick to decide 
which position to fill next so that we never break the up-down pattern. In the end, this makes sure the 
sequence has the correct wiggle shape without needing extra memory or sorting everything fully.
