Imagine you're at the bottom of a staircase with *n* steps, and you're allowed to climb either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. You want to figure out how many different ways you can reach the top. If there's only 1 step, there's clearly just one way to climb itâ€”take a single step. If there are 2 steps, there are two possible ways: either take two 1-step moves or one 2-step move. Now consider 3 steps. To get to the third step, you could either come from the second step by taking 1 step, or from the first step by taking 2 steps. So the number of ways to get to the third step is just the number of ways to get to the second step plus the number of ways to get to the first step.

This pattern continues for every step beyond that. The number of ways to reach step *n* is simply the sum of the ways to reach step *n-1* and step *n-2*. This is the same logic used in the Fibonacci sequence. The idea is to build up the solution by solving smaller subproblems first, then using those to solve bigger ones. You avoid recalculating by storing the previous results and using them directly, making the solution efficient. In essence, you're climbing the staircase by combining paths you've already figured out for smaller numbers of steps.
