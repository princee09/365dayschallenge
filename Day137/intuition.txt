Imagine a group of houses connected by one-way roads, where each house can have at most one road leading out of it. You’re given two starting houses (say, node1 and node2), and you want to find a house that both people can reach by following these roads, such that the slowest person takes as little time as possible to get there. Think of each step along the road as one unit of time. So, we let both people walk along the roads starting from their houses and record how long it takes them to reach every other house. After that, we go through all the houses and check which ones are reachable by both people. Among these, we pick the house where the person who took longer still had the least maximum time, and if there’s a tie, we pick the house with the smallest number. This ensures both can meet at the most convenient house as quickly as possible.
