43. Multiply Strings




Imagine you are multiplying two big numbers, like 123 × 456, but instead of doing it 
using a calculator, you do it by hand on paper. You multiply each digit from the first 
number with each digit from the second number, just like school method. You write the 
results and carry over the extra value when the multiplication is more than 10.
In the code, we store each multiplication result in a specific position in a list (like a digital version of paper). 
Each place in the list represents the position of the digit in the final number.
At the end, we combine this list into one final number by handling the carry and removing any unnecessary zeros at the front.

The code basically simulates how humans multiply numbers on paper, but it does it step by step using code logic.











91. Decode Ways








Imagine you got a secret message written only in numbers. And someone tells you that 1 means A, 2 means B, and so on until 26 means Z.
Now, someone gives you a number string like "226". You want to know in how many ways you can convert it to letters.

You could split it like:

2 2 6 → B B F

22 6 → V F

2 26 → B Z

So total 3 ways to read it. But it gets tricky when there is a 0, because 0 does not have a letter. So we have to be careful and only allow valid combinations.
The code checks each number and each pair of numbers and sees if they can be turned into a letter. Then it adds how many ways there are to decode the message step by step.

It’s like counting how many paths you can take to read the message, where each step you can either take one digit or two digits (but only if they form a valid letter).
