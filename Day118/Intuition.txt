Imagine you’re walking down a row of houses and you want to find three red doors in a row. You go door by door: if you see a red door, you say “one,” then move on; if the next door is red, you say “two,” and so on. But the moment you hit a blue door, you forget your count and start over. As soon as you’ve counted three red doors back-to-back, you know your goal is met and you stop looking.

In the same way, our program scans each number in the list: if it’s odd, we bump up our “odd” counter; if it’s even, we reset that counter to zero. As soon as the counter reaches three, we know there are three odd numbers in a row, so we can immediately say “yes.” If we finish checking all the numbers without ever getting three in a row, we say “no.” That’s it—just like counting consecutive red doors, but with odd numbers!
