2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k



Imagine you have a long string of characters, like a rope made of letters. You want to cut 
this rope into smaller equal parts, each of size k. You start cutting from the 
beginning—first k letters go into one group, then the next k letters into the next 
group, and so on. If you reach the end and there's not enough letters left to make a full group, 
you add some filler characters (like sticking x's at the end) so that the last piece is also of the 
same size. This way, all your groups are equal in length, and you don’t lose or misplace any part of the original string.





5. Longest Palindromic Substring






Think of a word or sentence as a row of mirrors and try to find the longest part that looks 
the same when read from both sides—like how “madam” or “racecar” reads the same forwards and 
backwards. The goal is to find the biggest such symmetrical piece within the entire string. 
Instead of checking every possible combination (which would be slow), 
we use a clever trick: we expand from every letter outward in both directions, 
like opening arms, to check how far we can go while it still looks the same on both sides. 
We also use some special characters in-between to make even and odd-length symmetrical parts 
easier to detect. After going through the string this way, we pick the longest symmetrical part we found and return it.
