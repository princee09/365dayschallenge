342. Power of Four




Think of it like checking if a number came from multiplying 4 again and again starting from 1.
If the number is 1, we know it is 4 raised to the power 0, so it is valid.
If the number is less than or equal to 0, or it is not perfectly divisible by 4, then it can never be made by multiplying 4 again and again, so it is not valid.
Otherwise, we keep dividing the number by 4 and check again.
If we keep dividing and finally reach 1, then yes, it is a power of four.












459. Repeated Substring Pattern 





Here we want to see if the whole string is just a smaller piece repeated again and again.
We try every possible length for the smaller piece, starting from 1 character to half the size of the string.
If the total length of the string cannot be evenly split into pieces of that size, we skip it.
If it can be split evenly, we take the first piece and compare it with all the other pieces in the string one by one.
If all pieces match the first piece exactly, then the string is made of repeated parts.
If even one piece does not match, we try with a different piece size until we find a match or confirm it is not possible.
