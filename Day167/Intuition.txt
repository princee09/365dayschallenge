1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition





Imagine you have a group of numbers, and you're trying to find all the ways 
you can pick some of them such that the smallest number in the group and the 
biggest number together don't go over a given limit. To make this easier, first 
sort the numbers so that the smallest is on one end and the biggest is on the other.


Now, start from the smallest number and check, for each of them, what's the furthest 
biggest number you can pair with it so that the total is still under the limit. If it works, 
then all the combinations of numbers between them are good too, and the number of such 
combinations is a power of 2 based on how many numbers you have in between. This is 
because for each number, you can either include it or not, like flipping a switch on or off. 
Keep doing this until you've checked all such combinations, and finally add them all together to get your answer.










743. Network Delay Time









Think of a group of cities connected by roads, and you're sending a message from one 
city to the others. Each road takes a certain amount of time for the message to travel.
Your goal is to find out how long it will take for all cities to receive the message, 
and if any city can't get it at all, return -1.



To do this, always go to the nearest city you haven't visited yet, 
and from there, update how fast you can reach other cities from it. 
Keep track of the fastest time to each city and update it whenever you 
find a quicker route. At the end, check if every city got the message. 
If yes, the slowest one among them tells you the total time it took for the message to fully spread.
