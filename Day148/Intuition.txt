3442: Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I



Imagine you are looking at how many times each letter appears in a word. Now you want to find:

One letter that appears an odd number of times (like 5 times),

And another that appears an even number of times (like 2 times),
Then just subtract: 5 - 2 = 3.

The goal is to find the biggest possible difference like this between one odd and one even count.

So you look at all letters, check how many times each appears, collect the biggest odd count and the smallest even count, and subtract them.


We use a map to count each letter. Like keeping a record: "a: 5", "b: 2", "c: 1".

After that, we go through these numbers:

If the number is odd (like 5), we keep track of the largest one seen so far.

If it's even (like 2), we track the smallest one.

Then at the end, we subtract: biggest odd - smallest even.

It’s like finding the most "oddly repeated" letter and the least "evenly repeated" one and checking how far apart they are in number.



409: Longest Palindrome




We want to make a word that reads the same forwards and backwards (like "abba" or "racecar"). The rule is that letters on both sides must match.

So if a letter appears even times (like 4), we can use all of them—half on the left, half on the right.

If a letter appears odd times (like 5), we can only use 4 of them (leave one out) to keep it balanced.

But wait—we can place one odd letter in the middle of the palindrome (like the "c" in "abcba").

So in the end:

Use as many even counts as possible.

From the odd counts, use one less (like 5 becomes 4), and save one extra to place in the center.


We again count how many times each letter appears using a map.

Then for each letter:

If its count is even, we can use all of it.

If its count is odd, we use (count - 1) and remember that we found something odd.

If at least one odd-count letter exists, we add 1 more in the end, to place it in the center of our palindrome.

That’s how we calculate the maximum length of a word that can read the same backward and forward using letters from the original word.
