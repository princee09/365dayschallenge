Question 796. Rotate String

Think of the string like people standing in a line. A "shift" means the first person in line goes to the very end. 
If you keep doing this again and again, the line changes shape but the order of people stays the same, just rotated. 
To check if one string can become another through this shifting, we simply try all possible rotations one by 
one and see if at any point the new line of people matches the target line. If yes, the answer is true, otherwise false.






Question 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

Imagine you have two sentences and you want to find the longest pattern of letters that appear in both, 
in the same order, though not necessarily side by side. For example, in "abcde" and "ace", the 
letters "a", "c", and "e" appear in both in the same order, so that is the longest common subsequence. 
The way we solve this is by comparing letters of both words step by step and keeping track of the longest 
sequence found so far. If the letters match, we extend our sequence. If they donâ€™t, we keep the longer 
sequence we already had. By the end, we know the length of the longest chain of matching letters that both strings share.
