1929. Concatenation of Array




The problem is asking us to take a list of numbers and make a new list that is just two copies of the original 
stuck together. To solve this, we first create a new empty list of double the size. Then we go through each number 
in the original list. For each number, we place it once in the front half of the new list and once again in the back half. 
In the end, the new list looks like the original list written two times one after another. This works in one straight pass, 
so it is fast and simple.








956. Tallest Billboard





Here the problem is like building two poles of equal height from given rods. We want both poles to be as tall as possible, 
and we do not have to use all rods. The tricky part is to decide which rods go to the left pole, which rods go to the 
right pole, and which rods we skip. The idea is to keep track of the difference in height between the two poles while 
adding rods one by one. For each rod, we try three things: add it to the left pole, add it to the right pole, or ignore it. 
We record what maximum tallness we can achieve for each difference. At the end, when the difference is zero, 
it means both poles are the same height, and that height is our answer.
