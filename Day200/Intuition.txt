118. Pascal’s Triangle








Imagine Pascal’s Triangle like a triangle of numbers where each number is built using the two numbers directly above it.

You always start with 1 at the top. Then in every new row, you again put 1 at the beginning and 1 at the end. 
For the numbers in between, you just add the two numbers that are diagonally above it from the previous row.

So this code creates an empty list to hold all the rows of the triangle. Then it builds each row one by one. 
For each row, it fills the first and last numbers with 1, and fills the middle numbers using the two numbers from the row above.

This way, it builds all the rows up to the number you asked for.














506. Relative Ranks








You are given a list of scores, like a competition where each person has a score. 
The task is to give them ranks based on their scores. The highest score gets the "Gold Medal", the 
second highest gets the "Silver Medal", the third gets the "Bronze Medal", and the rest 
just get their position number as a string like "4", "5" and so on.

So this code first remembers which score belonged to which person using pairs — one part is the 
score and the other is the person's original position in the list. Then it sorts the list of scores from highest to lowest.

After sorting, it goes through the sorted scores and gives medals to the top three and 
numbers to the rest. Finally, it puts the medals or rank strings back into their correct original places and returns the list.
