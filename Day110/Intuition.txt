Thought for a couple of seconds


Think of the linked list as a racetrack and two pointers as two runners, Fast and Slow:

1. **The Dummy “Starting Gate”**
   Before the race even begins, we place an extra “dummy” node just before the real head of the list. This dummy acts like a universal starting gate so that even if we need to remove the very first real node, our method still works without special‑casing it.

2. **Fast Gets a Head‑Start**
   We line up both Fast and Slow at the dummy. Then we let Fast run ahead by n + 1 steps. Why n + 1? Because we want Slow to end up exactly one node before the one we must remove. That extra one‑step cushion makes the math line up neatly.

3. **Neck‑and‑Neck to the Finish**
   Now Fast is ahead, and Slow is still at the dummy. We move both pointers forward together, one node at a time. Fast keeps its lead of n + 1 nodes. When Fast finally reaches the end of the list (nullptr), Slow is sitting just before the target node (the nth from the end).

4. **Removing the Target**
   Slow’s next pointer is the unwanted node. To remove it, we simply bypass it:


   slow->next = slow->next->next;


   That unlinks the target from the chain. If you’re managing memory manually (in C++), you’d then delete the removed node to avoid a leak.

5. **Why It’s O(1) Space and One Pass**

   * We only ever used two pointers and one dummy—constant extra space.
   * We advanced through the list only once with Fast (and in lock‑step with Slow), so it’s a single O(sz) pass.

By imagining the two pointers as racers and the dummy as an extra starting block, the procedure becomes intuitive: give Fast the head‑start, run together to the finish, then let Slow do the removal.

Imagine you need to find the largest integer whose square does not exceed x, but you’re not allowed to just take a built‑in square‑root function. Instead, picture the range of possible answers from 0 up to x. You can efficiently zero in on the correct integer by using binary search:

Start with two pointers, left = 0 and right = x.

Check the midpoint, mid = (left + right)/2.

If mid² is less than or equal to x, then mid is a valid candidate for ⌊√x⌋—but there might be a larger integer that still works, so move left up to mid+1.

If mid² is greater than x, mid is too big, so move right down to mid−1.

By repeatedly halving the interval [left, right], you quickly converge on the largest mid whose square fits under x. The variable ans remembers the last valid mid. When left passes right, ans holds ⌊√x⌋. This runs in O(log x) time and uses only constant extra space.
