133. Clone Graph 





Imagine you are given a map of a city where each house has a number and a 
list of neighboring houses it is connected to. Now, your job is to create an 
exact duplicate of this city map. But instead of just copying what you see, 
you need to recreate each house and its connections from scratch. This means 
every time you visit a house, you must create a new house with the same number 
and then go and make copies of all the houses connected to it. To avoid going in 
circles or copying the same house again and again, you keep a record of which houses 
\you've already copied. This way, when you reach a house that was already created, 
you just link to the existing copy instead of starting over. In the end, you have a 
completely new city map that looks exactly like the original one but is built with brand new houses and roads.







207. Course Schedule 







Think of each course you want to study as a chapter in a book. Some 
chapters can be read only after you read others. For example, to understand 
Chapter 5, you must first read Chapter 2. If you are given a list of all such chapter 
rules, your job is to figure out whether it is possible to read all chapters without 
getting stuck. You start by reading chapters that don’t require any other chapter to be 
read first. Then, once those are done, you check which chapters are now unlocked because 
their required chapters are completed. You keep doing this step by step. If at some point 
you find that no more chapters can be read because each of the remaining ones is waiting on 
another, it means you’re stuck in a loop. In that case, it's impossible to read all chapters. 
But if you finish reading all of them by following the rules, then it means it's fully possible to complete the course.
