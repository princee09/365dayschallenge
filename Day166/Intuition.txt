2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum





Imagine you are given a list of numbers, and someone asks you to pick only a 
few (say 2 or 3) numbers from that list so that the total of those picked numbers is 
as big as possible. But there is a rule — you cannot just pick the biggest numbers randomly. 
You must pick them in the same order as they appeared in the original list. For example, 
if 5 comes before 3 in the list, and you want both, you cannot swap their order.


So, what the code does is: it goes through the list and keeps track of the top few 
biggest numbers along with where they were in the list. It then sorts these selected 
numbers based on their original position so that the final answer respects the order. 
Finally, it gives you the group of numbers that has the biggest total but still follows the original list's order.








310. Minimum Height Trees







Think of a tree not as a plant, but as a web of connected points — like a family tree or 
a network of friends, where each person is connected to others. Now, you're told to pick 
one or two people (or points) in this network and make them the boss or the head so that 
the network becomes as balanced as possible. A balanced tree means it does not stretch 
too far in any direction — it stays short and centered.

To do this, the code removes people from the outer edge of the network — 
the ones connected to only one other person — because these outer points 
make the tree tall. It keeps removing the outer layers, just like peeling an onion, 
until only one or two people remain in the center. These are the best choices for leaders 
if you want a balanced structure. These final one or two nodes are returned as the answer.
