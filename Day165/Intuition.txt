1791. Find Center of Star Graph


Imagine you have a group of people standing in a circle, and there is one person 
in the middle who is shaking hands with everyone else. You are given a list of pairs showing who shook hands with whom.

Now, the person in the center will be mentioned in every handshake because they are 
the only one shaking hands with all. So, if you just look at the first two handshakes, the person who appears in both of them must be the center.

That's all the code does. It checks who appears in both the first and second pair, and returns that person.






841. Keys and Rooms



You are standing outside a hallway with many locked rooms. Only room 0 is open. 
Inside each room, there might be keys to other rooms.

You start from room 0, pick up all the keys you find there, and go unlock the rooms 
those keys open. Then in those rooms, you might find more keys, and so on. You keep doing this until you can't open any new rooms.

At the end, you check if you have been inside every room. If yes, you return true, which 
means it is possible to visit all rooms. Otherwise, you return false.

So the idea is simple: start with the only open room, keep collecting and using keys, and make sure you've been to every room by the end.
